    Overview
    ===================================

    This is not intended to be an 'ultimate' guide to secure password
    generation.  Instead, our objective is to strike a balance between
    practicality and security. For example, we are not providing a
    large sets of bells-and-whistles for users to pick amongst, since
    that puts the onus on the user to have some basic computer science
    / math / cryptography knowledge. We may release a more
    parameterized version of this work in the future.

    Our choice is thus to present two options for users, that
    correspond to the most common needs:

    1) a short but strong password that you can write down
    2) a similarly strong but easier to remember password

    (We removed for now generating pincodes)

    Our choice of (ASCII) characters for encoding are:

       #$%+/23456789=?@ABCDEFGHJKLMNPRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz

    This follows from a long set of considerations (see below). Our target
    is 64, as it is an exponent of 2, which has some technical benefits.
    To go much above 64 turns makes the symbols harder for users.


    Background: choice of character set
    ===================================

    We are fans of Gibson's work (https://www.grc.com/ppp.htm), and largely
    agree with his choice of 64 characters to pick from:

       !#%+23456789:=?@ABCDEFGHJKLMNPRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz

    This set carefully avoids ambiguous characters, so it can be used
    in various contexts, with little loss of entropy, while also being
    an exponent of 2, making it convenient in contexts where the
    result corresponds to binary. But it has some issues, so we
    revisit it, and reconstruct the process (basically tracking Gibson
    but with slightly different decisions).

    Our starting point is "Base64"; ironically (or appropriately), b64
    dates to RFC 989 (by John Linn in 1986) which was covering how to
    encode encrypted email:

       1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234
       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/

    (The character "=" was set aside for padding.)

    These were intended for computers to use. For humans, some of these
    have problems. To begin with, some are ambiguous:

       IOQl01

    Which Gibson's design (which also omits using '/') replaces with:

       !#%+:=?@

    We agree with choice of ambiguous characters to omit ('IOQl01'),
    however we modify the replacements a bit, based on common and
    easily accessible keys on most western keyboards, and later on
    below, considerations of pen-and-paper.

    Thus, we have the starting point of 56 unambiguous characters:

       ABCDEFGHJKLMNPRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz23456789

    Which means we need to select a total of 8 additional characters.

    Standard US/UK 'Qwerty' has the following symbols easily
    accessible on 'compact' (60%) or bigger formats:

       ~!@#$%^&*()_+-=`[]{}\|;:'",<.>/?

    More compact US/UK keyboard layouts will omit a few more keys:

       ~`|\


    German keyboard layouts (T1 or T2 - DIN 2137-1:2012-06) need
    some local language and European symbols, so will lack trivial
    access to the following:

       @{}[]\|

    So we eliminate those, except for '@', which whilst obscure on the
    keyboard, is commonly needed on computers, so we can expect users
    will know how to generate it.

    Similar to '@', moving to Nordic language keyboards, they don't
    have trivial access to '$', but, again, relatively common for
    computer users to need, so by same logic we keep it.


    Latin language keyboards (such as Spanish or Italian) do not have
    easy access to '#', but yet again, fairly common in computer use.

    We also have some remaining ambiguities in the special characters,
    e.g. it's best to only pick one of '.,' and only one of ';:', and
    perhaps avoid any of the quotation ('`") characters.


    Finally, we take pen-and-paper considerations: passwords are often
    written down, and some characters can be tricky to distinguish;
    symbols that are largely vertical lines for example:

       /[]{}()

    Also, a left-handed friend convinced us that '!' is more annoying
    for left-handed writers than '#', so we swap those.

    Special characters available to us, in descending preference,
    now total 28:

       1234567890123456789012345678
       #@$%/+=?:!&*()_-^'"<>[]{}.,;


    Per above, we need 8, so in the end we select '#@$%/+=?'. Our
    final (total) preference list can be quibbled over, but the
    important question is - are *any* of these:

       :!&*()_-^'"<>[]{}.,;

    easier to write and/or type, or read/write) than *any* of:

       #@$%/+=?

    An argument could be made for replacing '/', and thus entirely
    avoiding 'vertical line confusion', however, it happens to be
    prominent on standard keyboard layouts, which we feel trumps for
    example '&' (which is also inconvenient in pen-to-paper).

    As an aside, the characters "<>&" are all problematic in HTML.

    Comparing where we landed compared with Gibson:

       !#%+:=?@    [Gibson]
       $#%/+=?@    [moi]

    Yes ... that's right ... after all that work we ended up being
    identical to Gibson, except we replace '!' with '$' ... so shoot
    me, Steve is a sharp dude, he did a solid job (back in 2007).

    Our final set is:

       #$%+/23456789=?@ABCDEFGHJKLMNPRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz
       1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234

    (Above in the order they appear in ASCII)

    We refer to this as 'base64mi v01 (2021)'.

    Future work: we might want to reduce this by a lot, to accomodate
    left-handed writers, arthritic writers, common fine motor skill
    challenges, and so forth, perhaps add an 'accessibility'
    checkbox. However, we have not found any definitive research in
    this area, so we don't have a firm basis ourselves to proceed (or
    even judge how useful it would be), beyond some minor design
    choices above (notably that '!' appears to be harder for
    left-handed writers).  (Update - we've partially addressed this
    below with 'base32mi')


    ===================================
    TODO: working on 'leet-speak' transform of the generated pass
    phrases, so as to naturally include 'one capital letter, one
    number, and one symbol', as a common online password requirement
    criteria. The iterator under consideration is to look for these
    opportunities in a generated phrased:

    a->'4', b->'8' e->'3', t->'7', g->'&', h->'#', s->'$', x->'%'

    Note that the numbers/symbols we've selected from above are the
    source of mapping ('#$%+/23456789=?@').

    We deliberately avoid some common transforms that will result in
    ambiguity, especially in pen-to-paper storage, that includes not
    using '0' and '1' at all, continuing to avoid 'single vertical
    line' confusion (e.g. c->'(')), and avoiding introducing new
    ambiguities (such as, b->'6', g/G->'9/6', s/S->'5', and t->'+',
    but accepting e/E->'3' since it's reversed).  Avoiding vertical
    'lines' also excludes some otherwise interesting tupples such as
    B->'13', D->'[)', H->'|-|', P->'|>', U->'[_]', though they mostly
    apply to capitalization.

    Selection of what symbol transform to apply should be random,
    which adds some bonus entropy, though for now we won't count it.
    There's no simple generic transform rule that can be reasonably
    memorized by a human, so the choice will require memorization.

    Instead of re-generating a phrase (in case no transform is
    available), the fall-back is to add '?' at the end (which
    obviously is zero entropy). For capitalization, instead of
    burdening with more memorization, we will simply capitalize the
    first available letter (after symbol transforms) starting with the
    third position, regardless of the phrase. Similarly if no number
    transform results from the above, we will simply insert the
    current year (e.g. '2020') after the first word (again, zero
    entropy).


    ===================================
    2022-07-14

    Adding 'base32mi' encoding option. This encodes in chunks of 5
    bits rather than 6. It removes all known common transcription
    errors (that we have been able to determine):

       0123456789abcdefyhEjkLmnHpFrRTUW
       12345678901234567890123456789012

    See the 'base64mi.v03.txt' file for details.

    A system that supports *entry* of a base32mi string can optionally
    "error correct" using the following JS snippet:

    str.replace(/OoQD/g,'0').replace(/lIiJ/g,'1').replace(/Zz/g,'2').replace(/A/g,'4').replace(/Ss/g,'5').replace(/G/g,'6').replace(/t/g,'7').replace(/B/g,'8').replace(/gq/g,'9').replace(/C/g,'c').replace(/Y/g,'y').replace(/kxX/g,'K').replace(/M/g,'m').replace(/h/g,'n').replace(/p/g,'P').replace(/uvV/g,'U').replace(/w/g,'w');
   
    NIST recommends 8 characters if chosen by user, 6 if by system.:
    https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63b.pdf

    They define characters as being at least 64-sized dictionary (and
    should accept spaces), or 36 "truly random" bits.  This means that
    eight (8) randomly generated base32mi characters (assigned by
    system) are sufficient: that's 40 bits, and the constraint of "one
    of each of number, lowercase, and uppercase" drops this to 39.8.
    
    base32mi does not contain any symbols, and some (outdated) sites
    require at least one symbol.

    From our analysis of keyboards etc for the base64mi design,
    we know that the "?" symbol is the least problematic, and it's
    also one that is common at the end of ordinary sentences. Ergo
    we would recommend simply adding "?" at the end for any situation
    where the system requires a symbol.
